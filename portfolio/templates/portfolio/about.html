        <p> <b>Executive Summary:</b> </p>

        <p>Aspiring to become a software engineer, I'm in the junior year of a B.S. in Computer Science at Western Governor's University.  Received a certificate in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) after learning drone flight, spatial analysis, and Python scripting which I used to build an internal tool for the Oregon Metro Data Research Center. Fluent in Mandarin Chinese and culturally aware after living in China for four years. Formerly a restaurant manager, once a language teacher, I bring a unique background to the table that combines international context, situational dexterity, empathetic communication, and technical skill. </p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>Motivations:</b> </p>
        <p>Multitudes of technological innovations converge into a chance for humanity to become a sustainable Type I Civilization. Companies like Tesla, Siemens, and Nvidia are proving that a long-term perspective is a viable business model. Electrification of transportation, digital twins of ecological interfaces, and recycling systems driven by artifical intelligence are essential innovations and are largely enabled by advanced computational systems. I am excited about the opportunity to play what role I can in this global revolution.</p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>Background:</b> </p>
        <p>Solving problems and taking on hard challenges has always been part of my life. Instead of going straight to college after high school, I saved up for a year and bought a one-way ticket to China so I could learn one of the most difficult languages on the planet and experience the challenge of living in a very foreign country for four years. Teaching English full-time, taking language classes at a university, studying at home, and getting impromptu Chinese lessons from taxi drivers all led to quickly developing a high level of proficiency in Chinese. By the end of my time in China, I was interpreting at  business meetings, discussing politics with local government leaders, and translating business documents.</p>
        <p>As for my education in the United States, I became interested in our global environmental problems. Instead of taking the obvious approach of studying Environmental Sciences, I pursued a certificate program in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS), where I learned how to fly drones, process geospatial data, and create beautiful maps. I also discovered I had more interest and aptitude in the underlying Python code, than making the actual maps. At the end of the program, I was selected for a client project with a local government organization called the Oregon Metro Data Research Center, where I worked with a GIS specialist to integrate a Python script into a user-friendly tool to be used by another department. This entailed refactoring code, writing tests, and testing the GUI.</p>
        <br>
        <p> <b>A few personal details:</b> </p>
        <p>Originally from the smallest state of New England, I now reside in Portland, Oregon, with my partner and our axolotl. I'm an amateur guitarist, budding pianist, and pro-level drummer. I read everyday. I'm more interested in learning C++ than the latest JavaScript framework. My favorite films are the Matrix Trilogy and the Lord of the Rings. </p>
