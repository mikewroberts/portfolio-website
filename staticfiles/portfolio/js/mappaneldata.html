<p><b>Question</b></p>
<p>Is it possible to feed a high population area such as Portland Oregon using alternative permaculture-based agricultural methods?</p><br><br>

<p><b>Basic Setup</b></p>
<p>Use a well-known permaculture farmstead as a model to apply to large-scale agricultural operations.</p>
<p>Calculate total land needed to supply average American caloric intake with average crops.</p>
<p>Use the buffer tool in a unique way to determine how much land directly outside city limits would be needed to produce the food needed.</p>

<!-- Process -->

<p><b>Map Creation</b></p>
<p>Imported the Portland Urban Growth Boundary and cut it out of the agricultural zoning area, using the Intersect Tool. </p>
<p>Used the Buffer Tool on the city boundary with an arbitrary buffer distance.</p>
<p>Clipped the new buffer zone with the agricultural zone.</p>
<p>Calculated the area of new buffer shape and compared with desired area output.</p>
<p>Exported process to a model.</p>
<p>Ran the model repeatedly with new input parameters until the desired area was achieved. This was done with a manual version of a "binary search" which is programming's way of performing a very efficient guess-and-check.</p>
<p>Exported map features to Adobe Illustrator and stylized using custom graphics.</p>
